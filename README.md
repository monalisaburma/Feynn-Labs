# Feynn Labs Internship Projects

## Task 1: AI Product/Service Prototyping for Small Business

In this project, I conceptualized and implemented an AI-powered Mental Health Prediction app. The aim was to prototype a product/service idea for small businesses. Utilizing Support Vector Machine (SVM) machine learning algorithm, I developed a predictive model using a dataset sourced from Kaggle. The target variable was the mental health status, and I performed visualization to enhance understanding.

- File Structure:
  - `mental_health_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with the implementation.
  - `StressLevelDataset.csv`: Dataset used for training.
  - `Mental Health Prediction.pdf`: Report detailing the project.

## Task 2: Market Segmentation Study - McDonald's Case Study

This project involved conducting a market segmentation analysis for McDonald's using empirical data. The goal was to identify distinct consumer segments with different perceptions of McDonald's. Various techniques such as k-means clustering, global stability assessment, and regression models were employed for analysis.

- File Structure:
  - `mcdonald_case_study.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the case study.
  - `mcdonalds.csv`: Dataset used for analysis.
  - `Market Segmentation Study Report.pdf`: Comprehensive report on the market segmentation study.

## Task 3: EV Market Segmentation

The focus of this project was to provide a comprehensive understanding of the electric vehicle market in India. Two datasets, `ElectricCarData_Norm.csv` and `Indian_behaviour.ipynb`, were used for market segmentation, aiming to identify trends, consumer preferences, and market dynamics.

- File Structure:
  - `Electric_car.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for EV market segmentation.
  - `Indian_behaviour.ipynb`: Analysis of Indian automobile buying behavior.
  - `EV Market Segmentation.pdf`: Report summarizing the findings.

## Task 4: Mental Health Prediction App using Streamlit

Developed a Streamlit app for predicting mental health status based on various features. The app utilizes a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model trained on the `StressLevelDataset.csv`. Users can input information through sliders and receive predictions.

- File Structure:
  - `streamlit_code`: Directory containing Streamlit app code.
  - `mental_health_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with model training.
  - `AI powered Mental Health Prediction.pdf`: Report on the Streamlit app.

### How to Use the Streamlit App:

1. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Run the app with `streamlit run streamlit_app.py`.
3. Adjust sliders for each feature, click 'Predict,' and interpret the results.

- The app is deployed using Streamlit.

### Access the Deployed Streamlit App
